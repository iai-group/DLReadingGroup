  * [Presentation slides](Regularization.pptx)
  * [Environment](environment/)
    - I used anaconda virtual environment with python 3.5.2. In case someone will have problems with configuring virtual environment with TensorFlow they can create the environment from the backup 'tensorFlow.yml' file. This file only contains all necessary package dependencies.
  * [Notebooks](notebooks/): regularization (overfitting, l2 regularization and dropout), early stopping, bagging and adversarial noise.
